# YT-DLP-Imp
A GUI for a youtube downloader library (yt-dlp)

## How do i use this?
Pretty simple just open the "YT-DLP-Imp.exe" and from there I am sure everything will be clear.

## Common Issues
Could not find ffmpeg, ffplay or ffprobe  [+]  Just watch a youtube video on how to install ffmpeg.

## Credits
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp Is the base for this program even though i am not required to mention them by law because they go under the "unlicense" license i will still do.

## License
Because the original "yt-dlp" goes under the "unlicense" license. I decided to also choose the "unlicense" license.
